        <h2>Why I prefer dogs over cats.</h2>
        <p>I prefer dogs over cats because I think that dogs show more love than cats. Cats mostly just lays around and does not show as much love as a dog, but on the other hand dogs are very funny and playful and is a joy to be around. Also If you are having a bad day dogs will comfort you and be your best friend no matter what because that is their amazing personality. Cats will not really comfort you and sometimes not even like you because theat is how they are.</p>
